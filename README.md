## Overview  

**ink-100%** is an interactive platform for **ink-negative** that explores the *poetics of technology* —  
the interface where **language**, **motion**, and **code** converge.  
The system turns user movements into **generative typography**, choreographing words in real-time.  
It blurs the line between **writing and drawing**, between **reading and performing**.  

This week’s focus was on transforming static HTML into a **dynamic system** using JavaScript arrays.  
Instead of hardcoding text and elements, the page now generates typographic compositions **from structured data**.
